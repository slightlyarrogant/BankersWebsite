# BankersWebsite
A simple website that downloads the financial informations of a company and allows user to ask questions in natural language. Requires ollama and llama2:13b model.

This is one of my first succesful projects running LLM. It is quite fast and accurate. The financial data of my company are provided in a pdf file with text and tables. You can experiment with other companies and download their financial reports.
Beware of the complex graphical pdf as the pdf reader will not capture all data if the formatting is complicated. With a tweak to the prompt the website can answer in another language - 
for example you can ask questions in French and receive it in French as well.
