# Bankers Website User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bankers Website user manual. This manual will guide you on how to use the Bankers Website, a simple website that allows users to ask questions and receive answers. The website is built using Flask and Jinja, and it utilizes a separate code written by the Chief Product Officer to generate responses to user questions.

## Installation

To use the Bankers Website, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to install the required dependencies and set up the environment:

1. Clone the Bankers Website repository from GitHub: [Bankers Website Repository]

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   - Run `python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment named "venv".
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows, run `venv\Scripts\activate`.
     - On macOS and Linux, run `source venv/bin/activate`.

4. Install the required dependencies:
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Flask.

## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can start using the Bankers Website. Follow these steps to run the website locally:

1. Make sure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated (if you created one).

2. Run the following command to start the Flask development server:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the Bankers Website.

4. On the website, you will see a text input field labeled "Ask a question". Type your question in the input field and click the "Ask" button.

5. The website will display your question and the corresponding answer generated by the separate code written by the Chief Product Officer.

6. You can ask as many questions as you want, and the website will keep displaying them in a chat-like form.

## Customization

If you want to customize the Bankers Website, you can modify the code files provided in the repository:

- `main.py`: This file contains the Flask application and routes for handling user requests. You can modify the routes or add new functionality as per your requirements.

- `response.py`: This file contains the function to generate responses for user questions. You can modify the logic in the `get_answer` function to generate custom answers based on the questions.

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML template for the website. You can modify the structure and styling of the website by modifying the HTML code.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and used the Bankers Website. You can now ask questions and receive answers on the website. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact the support team. Enjoy using the Bankers Website!
