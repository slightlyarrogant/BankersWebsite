Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a code for a simple website - called 'Bankers Website' which will have only a place to ask question. Once the question is called a separate code written by me would be called and the answer will be provided by a separate, written by me function called response which called with query will provide reply. You will display the question and the following answer. You will allow user to ask as many questions they want and keep displaying them in a chat like form. Preferably use the flask and jinja..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Explanation:

1. The main file, `bankers_website.py`, is responsible for handling user requests and rendering the HTML templates. It uses the Flask framework to create a web application. The `/` route renders the `index.html` template, and the `/ask` route handles the form submission and calls the `get_answer` function from `response.py` to generate the answer.

2. The `response.py` file contains the `get_answer` function, which takes a question as input and returns an answer. You can replace the logic inside this function with your own code to generate the answer based on the question.

3. The `index.html` template is a simple HTML form that allows the user to ask a question. When the form is submitted, the question is sent to the `/ask` route, and the question and answer are displayed on the page.

Make sure to install Flask (`pip install flask`) before running the code. You can run the application by executing the `bankers_website.py` file.

<COMMENT>
The code looks good overall, but there is one improvement that can be made. In the `ask` route of the `main.py` file, the question and answer are being passed to the template, but the answer is not being displayed in the HTML. 

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to update the `index.html` file to display the answer. Below the line `<h3>Question: {{ question }}</h3>`, add a new line `<h3>Answer: {{ answer }}</h3>`.

Here is the updated code for `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Bankers Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Bankers Website</h1>
    <form action="/ask" method="post">

        <h3>Question: {{ question }}</h3>

Once you make this change, the answer will be displayed on the webpage along with the question.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code looks good overall, but there is one improvement that can be made. In the `ask` route of the `main.py` file, the question and answer are being passed to the template, but the answer is not being displayed in the HTML. 

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to update the `index.html` file to display the answer. Below the line `<h3>Question: {{ question }}</h3>`, add a new line `<h3>Answer: {{ answer }}</h3>`.

Here is the updated code for `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Bankers Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Bankers Website</h1>
    <form action="/ask" method="post">

        <input type="submit" value="Ask">

    {% if question %}
        <h3>Question: {{ question }}</h3>
        <h3>Answer: {{ answer }}</h3>
    {% endif %}
</body>
</html>
```

Once you make this change, the answer will be displayed on the webpage along with the question."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
In the `index.html` file, the conditional statement for displaying the answer is missing. Currently, it only checks if the `question` variable is present, but it doesn't check if the `answer` variable is present. This can lead to a potential error if the `answer` variable is not defined.

To fix this, you can modify the conditional statement in the `index.html` file as follows:

```html
{% if question %}
    <h3>Question: {{ question }}</h3>
    {% if answer is defined %}
        <h3>Answer: {{ answer }}</h3>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

This change ensures that the answer will only be displayed if it is defined, preventing any potential errors.

Once you make this change, the code should be ready for testing and deployment.

<INFO> Please make the suggested change in the `index.html` file to fix the conditional statement for displaying the answer.

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a code for a simple website - called 'Bankers Website' which will have only a place to ask question. Once the question is called a separate code written by me would be called and the answer will be provided by a separate, written by me function called response which called with query will provide reply. You will display the question and the following answer. You will allow user to ask as many questions they want and keep displaying them in a chat like form. Preferably use the flask and jinja..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
In the `index.html` file, the condition for displaying the answer is not correct. Currently, it checks if the `answer` variable exists, but it should check if the `answer` variable is not empty. This is because even if the `answer` variable exists, it might be an empty string if the question does not have a valid answer.

To fix this, update the condition in the `index.html` file as follows:

```html
{% if question %}
    <h3>Question: {{ question }}</h3>
    {% if answer != '' %}
        <h3>Answer: {{ answer }}</h3>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

This will ensure that the answer is only displayed if it is not empty.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Write a code for a simple website - called 'Bankers Website' which will have only a place to ask question. Once the question is called a separate code written by me would be called and the answer will be provided by a separate, written by me function called response which called with query will provide reply. You will display the question and the following answer. You will allow user to ask as many questions they want and keep displaying them in a chat like form. Preferably use the flask and jinja..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of your project. In this case, the `requirements.txt` file should include the following dependencies:

```
Flask==1.1.2
```

This specifies that the project requires Flask version 1.1.2. Flask is a web framework for Python that is used in the Bankers Website project.

You can create the `requirements.txt` file by following these steps:

1. Open a text editor or IDE.
2. Create a new file and name it `requirements.txt`.
3. Add the dependency `Flask==1.1.2` to the file.
4. Save the file in the root directory of your project.

Your `requirements.txt` file should now contain the following:

```
Flask==1.1.2
```

This file can be used by other developers or deployment tools to install the required dependencies for the project.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
